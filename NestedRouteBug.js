In React Router Dom v6, if you are using nested routes and have a route parameter in a parent route that you also want to use in a child route, you might encounter unexpected behavior if you don't handle the parameter carefully.  The child route might not receive the parameter correctly, leading to errors or incorrect rendering.  Specifically, if you define the parameter in the parent route's path as `:parentId`, the nested routes would try to match against the entire string of the parent's ID, causing a mismatch.
