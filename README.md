This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes and parameters in React Router Dom v6. The bug showcases how a child route might fail to receive a parameter correctly from its parent route. The solution provides a corrected implementation to resolve this problem, ensuring seamless parameter passing between nested routes.  This is a helpful example to illustrate proper handling of parameters across nested route structures.
